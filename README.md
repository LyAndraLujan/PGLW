# PGLW.-
Pop Gen the Long Way (PGLW) is comprised of programs I wrote because my undergrad research adviser, Dr. Long, had me learn C++ instead of relying on other people's programs.


Programs:
-FormAndFunction: a program that reformats vcf files into simplified `.txt` files. Also reorders samples into their populations.
-PseudoHap: a program to pseudohaplodize `fasta` files. You need to know the number of sequence pairs in the `fasta` file in order to run it.
-SneakAPeak: This program pulls out the "header line" plus the meta line above it and the first 3 SNPs
of VCF files and puts them into a text file for viewing.
