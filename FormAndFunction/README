This program reformats VCF files into LyAndra Lujan's preferred format for working with them.
This format is also needed to work with other programs in PJLW that use data from a vcf.

SNP data is simplified to alleles only, and then samples are reordered into population groups.
A SamplesPop.txt file is necessary to reorder samples.
SamplesPop.txt should have samples and populations in the preferred order.

SamplesPop.txt file should not include headers, have samples in rows, and be formatted as:

OutOrder(starting with 0) '\t' Population name '\t' SampleID '\t' Original order 'endl'

Program Tasks:	only use first three characters of each samples SNP info.
					      reorder samples, and assign population names and numbers

Originally written by LyAndra Lujan in fall of 2018 for ALDH2-2 project working with the 1KGP dataset.
Updated so now reordering by population is optional.
Updated by LyAndra on 10/30/20 during work in the Singh lab on the HORMA
domain proteins project, it's first use was for C. elegans population genetics.
