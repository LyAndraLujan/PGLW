This program pulls out the "header line" plus the meta line above it and the first 3 SNPs
of VCF files and puts them into a text file for viewing.

How useful will other people find this? I don't know.
I use it to get just the sample IDs, see if the SNP data is phased or not, and check what the CHROM, POS, ID fields look like.

If you don't know how many meta lines are in the `.vcf`, I suggest the R package [vcfR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vcfR/index.html)
Even if the file is to big for R to hold, it will still tell you the number of meta lines, SNPs, and column count.
I would like to make a version of this that will tell you all of that information, but I probably won't.

domain protein project, it's first use was for C. elegans population genetics.
