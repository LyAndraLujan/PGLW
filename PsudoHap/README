PseudoHap is a program to pseudohaplodize fasta files.

You need to know the number of sequence pairs in the fasta file in order to run PseudoHap.

PseudoHap was written by LyAndra Lujan on January 1st, 21.
It was written to check if programs worked better on haplotyped data before taking the time to actually haplotype the data.
